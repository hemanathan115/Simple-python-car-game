# Simple-python-car-game

## 2.python car game 
This program defines a complete 2D car racing game using Pygame, where a player controls a car on a three-lane road using the left and right arrow keys to avoid incoming vehicles; the game window is set to 500×500 pixels with a road, lane markers, and moving enemy vehicles that spawn randomly from the top and move downward, increasing the player’s score each time they pass safely, while the game speed gradually increases after every five vehicles passed to raise difficulty; the program uses object-oriented design with sprite classes for the player and enemy vehicles, handles collision detection for both side-swipes and head-on crashes, displays a crash image and a game-over message upon collision, and allows the player to restart the game by pressing Y or exit by pressing N, making it a complete, interactive, keyboard-controlled racing game.
## Key Features

This car racing game includes key features such as a three-lane road system, smooth left and right keyboard controls, animated lane markers to create a moving road effect, randomly generated enemy vehicles with different designs, real-time collision detection for side and head-on crashes, a scoring system that increases when vehicles are safely passed, automatic speed increase to raise difficulty as the score grows, a clear game-over screen with a crash image, and restart or exit options, all built using object-oriented programming and Pygame sprite groups for efficient and structured gameplay.
